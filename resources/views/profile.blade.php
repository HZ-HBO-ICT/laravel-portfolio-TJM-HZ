        <h2>A bit about me</h2>
        <p>My name is Tim. I’m 19 years old and I live in Oostkapelle.<br>
            I live near the sea and I'm surrounded by forest<br>
            It really is quite a lovely place.</p>

        <div class="image-desc">A beach close to where I live</div>
        <br>
        <p>I recently started studying HBO-ICT at the Hogeschool Zeeland (HZ), because I want to learn how to design
            and develop software, <br>
            so that maybe one day, I can develop software for creatives (more on that can be found
            <a href=blog/on-the-topic-of-study-choice.html>here</a>). <br>
            I have a small amount of prior experience with programming, mostly stemming from my short-lived
            university experience (which I explain in more detail in <a
                href=blog/my-prior-experience-with-programming.html>this article</a>).<br>
            So far, my studies at the HZ are going well and I’m having a pretty good feeling about all this.
        </p>
        <p>On the rest of this page, you can read about my hobbies and interests.</p>

        <h2>Video Games</h2>
        <p>Par for the course for an ICT student I'd wager.</p>
        <p>Anyway, my taste in video games really is quite varied. <br>
            I like anything from relaxing single-player indie experiences to bombastic multiplayer movement
            shooters. <br>
        <p>I believe video games to be an artform with a lot of potential. <br>
            Not necessarily because of the graphics or the sounds, <br>
            but because of the oppurtunities interactivity bring to artistic expression,<br>
            whether that be big, dumb action or something deeper, something heartfelt, something unlike anything
            else.</p>
        <p>Below you'll find a small selection of some of my favorite video games.<br>
            Clicking on the cards will open a new tab with a trailer or store page for the game.<br>
            I highly recommend that you give these a try. You won't regret it.</p>

        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>There's something special about listening to ambient music while strolling over the beach at sunset.</p>
        <p>I'm mostly into ambient or otherwise relaxing music - <br>
            the type where you can lay down on your bed with an empty head <br>
            for what feels like minutes but what turns out to be an hour. <br>
            I can also appreciate some good soul, jazz and EDM.</p>
        <p>Below you'll find a small selection of Bandcamp embeds for you to listen to to get an idea of what kind
            of music I like to listen to.</p>

        <h1>Blender</h1>
        <p>No, not the thing that you use to make shakes. I'm talking about the software.</p>
        <p>Blender is a free and open-source 3D suite, allowing you to make some pretty crazy stuff.
            <br>
            I used it to create some of the images you see on this website. <br>
            I'd say it's also part of the reason <a href=blog/on-the-topic-of-study-choice.html>why I started
                studying ICT</a>.<br>
            The idea that an application so powerful and versatile is<br>
            free and open-source is pretty inspiring and made me want<br>
            to aid in developing such software myself one day.
